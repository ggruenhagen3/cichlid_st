# cichlid_st: Scripts for Cichlid Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
## Overview
The scripts in this github repository are for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA sequencing data from the cichlid forebrain. These datasets can be found here [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE217619) (spatial transcriptomics dataset is the GSE217615 SubSeries and the snRNA-seq dataset is the GSE211477 SubSeries). Additionally, this repository contains scripts for the comparison of these data to forebrain datasets from other vertebrate species. The following are links to the datasets used for each species: [axolotl](https://zenodo.org/record/6390083), [bird](https://cloud.biohpc.swmed.edu/index.php/s/nLicEtkmjGGmRF8), [turtle](https://public.brain.mpg.de/Laurent/ReptilePallium2018/), [mouse scRNA-seq (Zeisel et al)](http://mousebrain.org/adolescent/downloads.html), [mouse scRNA-seq (Saunders et al)](http://dropviz.org/), and [mouse spatial transcriptomics (Ortiz et al)](https://www.molecularatlas.org/download-data). Finally, these scripts contain hard-coded file paths and have not been designed nor tested on other systems.

This repository contains 3 directories and the code in each will be explained in detail below.
1. [clustering](https://github.com/ggruenhagen3/cichlid_st/tree/main/clustering): scripts for clustering spatial transcriptomics data
2. [cross_species](https://github.com/ggruenhagen3/cichlid_st/tree/main/cross_species): scripts for cross-species comparisons of transcriptomics data
3. [misc](https://github.com/ggruenhagen3/cichlid_st/tree/main/misc): miscellaneous scripts
