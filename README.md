# cichlid_st: Scripts for Cichlid Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
## Overview
The scripts in this github repository are for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics and single nucleus RNA sequencing data from the cichlid forebrain. These datasets can be found here __. Additionally, this repository contains scripts for the comparison of these data to forebrain datasets from other vertebrate species. These datasets can be found ___. Finally, these scripts contain hard-coded file paths and have not been designed nor tested on other systems.

This repository contains 3 directories and the code in each will be explained in detail below.
1. [clustering] ()
2. [cross_species] ()
3. [misc] ()
